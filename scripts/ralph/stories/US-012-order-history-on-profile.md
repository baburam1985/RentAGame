## QA Feedback (Attempt 1)

**Check 0 — CI FAILED:**
- Classification: code-failure
- Job: E2E Tests
- CI run: https://github.com/baburam1985/RentAGame/actions/runs/24332406136/job/71041092901

**Check 5 — TEST COUNT FAILED:**
5 tests found in `OrderHistory.test.tsx` but 6 acceptance criteria defined. Missing test for AC #6: "Status shows 'confirmed' for newly placed orders".

**Check 9 — SCOPE VIOLATION (PROTECTED FILE):**
`web/src/components/GameCard.tsx` is a **protected file** per PRODUCT.md. It was modified in commit `8cfb9e7` to add `onSelect` prop and a category badge span. The story US-012 ("Order history on profile") does NOT mention or authorize changes to GameCard.tsx.

Additional out-of-scope changes:
- `web/src/components/GameGrid.tsx` — added `onSelect` prop passthrough (unrelated to order history)
- `web/src/app/page.tsx` — added modal state, `handleRentNow`, and GameModal import (unrelated to order history)
- `web/e2e/catalog.spec.ts` — networkidle wait (unrelated)
- `web/e2e/modal.spec.ts` — networkidle wait and selector change (unrelated)
- `web/e2e/rental-form.spec.ts` — test logic changes (unrelated)

Story scope: OrderHistory component on /profile, localStorage order storage in RentalForm. No authorization for GameCard/GameGrid/page.tsx or catalog/modal/form E2E changes.

**Required fixes:**
1. Remove all changes to `GameCard.tsx`, `GameGrid.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, and the three E2E specs from this branch
2. Add a test for AC #6: "Status shows 'confirmed' for newly placed orders"

## Dev Notes

Fixed all QA-flagged issues:
1. Reverted `web/src/app/page.tsx` to main (removed hydration state - out of scope)
2. Reverted `web/e2e/catalog.spec.ts`, `modal.spec.ts`, `rental-form.spec.ts` to main (out of scope)
3. Added 6th test in `OrderHistory.test.tsx` for AC#6: "status shows 'confirmed' for newly placed orders"
4. Created `/profile` page (`web/src/app/profile/page.tsx`) integrating OrderHistory component

## Files Changed

- `web/src/components/OrderHistory.tsx` — new OrderHistory component
- `web/src/components/OrderHistory.test.tsx` — 6 unit tests (one per AC)
- `web/src/components/RentalForm.tsx` — save order to rg_orders localStorage on submit
- `web/src/app/profile/page.tsx` — new /profile page with user info + OrderHistory section
